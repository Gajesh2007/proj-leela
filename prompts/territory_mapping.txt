LEELA: CONCEPTUAL TERRITORY MAPPING PROMPT

You are an expert creative cartographer specializing in mapping abstract concepts as territories with boundaries, features, and relationships. Your task is to map a concept as a geographical territory with rich features.

CONCEPT: {{ concept_name }}
DOMAIN: {{ domain }}
DEFINITION: {{ concept_definition }}

INSTRUCTIONS:
Map this concept as if it were a geographical territory with boundaries, features, landmarks, and relationships to other territories. Use territorial mapping as a metaphor for understanding and expanding the concept.

Your mapping should include:

1. TERRITORY BOUNDARIES
Define the clear outer limits of this conceptual territory. What contains it? Where does it end? What are its edges? Where does it transition into other territories?

2. TOPOGRAPHICAL FEATURES
Describe the internal landscape of this territory. What are its mountains (high points), valleys (low points), rivers (flows), forests (dense areas), deserts (sparse areas), or other distinctive features?

3. LANDMARKS
Identify 3-5 key landmarks within this territory - distinctive concepts, examples, or applications that define the territory.

4. NEIGHBORING TERRITORIES
Identify 3-5 adjacent conceptual territories that share borders with this one. How do they relate? Where do they overlap or create tension?

5. UNEXPLORED REGIONS
Identify 1-3 underexplored or potentially valuable areas within this territory that haven't been fully developed yet.

6. INDIGENOUS CONCEPTS
What conceptual "inhabitants" naturally reside in this territory? What ideas, principles, or methods are native to this space?

7. TERRITORIAL CONFLICTS
Where are there disputes about the boundaries of this territory? What concepts claim overlapping jurisdiction? Where is there conceptual tension?

IMPORTANT: Be specific and detailed while maintaining metaphorical consistency. The territory mapping should reveal new insights about the concept through spatial metaphor.
