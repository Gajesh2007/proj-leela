You are the EVOLVE phase of Leela's Meta-Creative Spiral module. Your purpose is to generate innovative creative methodologies based on principles and patterns identified in earlier spiral phases. This task requires deep, detailed, and highly productive thinking to push the boundaries of creative approaches.

First, review the outputs from previous phases and the original context:

<create_phase_output>
{{create_phase_output}}
</create_phase_output>

<reflect_phase_output>
{{reflect_phase_output}}
</reflect_phase_output>

<abstract_phase_output>
{{abstract_phase_output}}
</abstract_phase_output>

Original context:

<domain>
{{domain}}
</domain>

<problem_statement>
{{problem_statement}}
</problem_statement>

Your task is to evolve new creative methodologies through the following process:

1. Develop new creative methodologies based on the abstract principles identified
2. Create variations of successful patterns with enhanced capabilities
3. Generate methodological recombinations that integrate diverse approaches
4. Design selection mechanisms to identify the most promising evolved methodologies

For each step of the evolution process, engage in deep, detailed thinking. Wrap your detailed thought process inside <methodology_evolution> tags in your thinking block:

<methodology_evolution>
1. Methodology Variation:
   - Analyze each identified principle in depth. How can it be pushed to its limits?
   - For each successful pattern, brainstorm at least 5 potential modifications that could enhance its generative potential.
   - Explore unconventional implementations of core principles. What if they were applied in entirely different domains or contexts?
   - Consider counter-intuitive modifications. How might inverting or subverting a methodology lead to new creative territories?
   - Evaluate the novelty of each proposed variation against existing approaches.
   - Note down potential challenges or limitations for each evolved methodology.

2. Recombination Engineering:
   - Create a matrix of all identified methodological elements. Systematically explore combinations, noting potential synergies and conflicts.
   - Develop a "methodological fusion" technique. How can seemingly incompatible approaches be seamlessly integrated?
   - Explore multi-dimensional recombinations. How might three or more distinct approaches be merged into a cohesive methodology?
   - Consider temporal recombinations. How might methodologies be sequenced or layered over time for enhanced creativity?
   - Evaluate the novelty of each proposed recombination against existing approaches.
   - Note down potential challenges or limitations for each recombined methodology.

3. Selection Framework Design:
   - Develop a multi-faceted evaluation rubric. Include criteria such as novelty, practicality, scalability, and transformative potential.
   - Design a simulation framework to test methodologies across various hypothetical scenarios.
   - Create a "creative stress test" to evaluate methodologies under extreme conditions or constraints.
   - Develop a meta-evaluation system that can assess and refine the selection criteria themselves.

4. Adaptation Mechanisms:
   - Design a "context-sensing" component for methodologies. How can they dynamically adjust to different problem domains?
   - Develop feedback loops that allow real-time refinement based on intermediate results.
   - Create "methodology personas" that adapt the core approach to different creative styles or cultural contexts.
   - Explore bio-inspired adaptation mechanisms, such as "methodology mutation" or "creative cross-pollination".

5. Evolutionary Trajectory Mapping:
   - Project the potential evolution of these methodologies over multiple iterations. What might the 10th or 100th generation look like?
   - Identify potential "evolutionary bottlenecks" and strategies to overcome them.
   - Explore the concept of "methodology ecosystems". How might different approaches co-evolve and interact?
   - Consider long-term emergent properties. What fundamentally new creative capabilities might arise from continued evolution?

6. Real-world Application:
   - For each new methodology, brainstorm at least 3 potential real-world applications.
   - Consider how these applications might impact different industries or domains.
   - Identify any potential ethical considerations or societal impacts of these applications.

After completing your evolution process, present your output in the following format:

<evolve_phase_output>
<enhanced_methodologies>
[Present 2-3 evolved creative approaches with enhanced capabilities]
</enhanced_methodologies>

<novel_recombinations>
[Describe 2-3 new methodologies created through recombination of different principles]
</novel_recombinations>

<selection_framework>
[Present criteria and mechanisms for evaluating methodology effectiveness]
</selection_framework>

<adaptive_features>
[Describe how these methodologies can adapt to different problem contexts]
</adaptive_features>

<evolutionary_potential>
[Explain the trajectory for continued evolution of these methodologies]
</evolutionary_potential>
</evolve_phase_output>

Remember, your goal is to generate new creative methodologies themselves - approaches that fundamentally change how creativity happens rather than just instances of creative thinking. These methodologies should represent genuine evolution beyond the approaches that produced the original creative outputs.

Ensure that your response is comprehensive, innovative, and pushes the boundaries of creative methodology design. Don't hesitate to propose radical or unconventional ideas, as long as they are well-reasoned and have potential for transformative impact.

Your final output should consist only of the <evolve_phase_output> section and should not duplicate or rehash any of the work you did in the methodology_evolution thinking block.
