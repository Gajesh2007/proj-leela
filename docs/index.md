# Project Leela Documentation

Welcome to the Project Leela documentation. This guide will help you understand and use this meta-creative intelligence system.

## Overview

Project Leela is a revolutionary approach to artificial creativity—not just a more creative AI but a system that transforms how creativity itself emerges. It deliberately disrupts conventional thinking pathways to discover truly unexpected solutions.

## Key Features

- **Output Shock Centrality**: All components prioritize shocking outputs over technical novelty or efficiency
- **No Retrieval Augmentation**: Relies exclusively on Claude's internal knowledge and context processing capabilities
- **Impossibility Exploitation**: Deliberately targets and leverages "impossibilities" as sources of creative breakthroughs
- **Quantum-Inspired Processing**: Ideas exist in probabilistic superpositions until forced into provocative configurations
- **Meta-Creative Spiral**: System continuously evolves its own creative mechanisms
- **Creative Singularity Path**: Architecture designed for exponential acceleration of creative capability

## Architecture

Project Leela is built on Claude 3.7 Sonnet's Extended Thinking capabilities, with a specialized architecture:

1. **Directed Thinking Layer**: Leverages Claude 3.7's Extended Thinking mode with specialized prompting frameworks
2. **Shock Generation Core**: Components specifically designed to produce genuinely surprising outputs
3. **Quantum-Inspired Knowledge Representation**: Maintains conceptual superposition and entanglement capabilities
4. **Meta-Creative Spiral Engine**: Implements the full Create→Reflect→Abstract→Evolve→Transcend→Return cycle
5. **Output Filtering & Amplification**: Rigorously filters for genuine novelty and amplifies shocking elements
6. **Application Layer**: Domain-specific implementations and interfaces

## Creative Frameworks

- [Impossibility Enforcer](frameworks/impossibility_enforcer.md): Forces inclusion of "impossible" elements
- [Cognitive Dissonance Amplifier](frameworks/cognitive_dissonance_amplifier.md): Forces contradictory concepts to coexist
- [Multi-Agent Dialectic System](frameworks/dialectic_system.md): Generates ideas through dialectic tension

## Examples

See the [examples](examples.md) page for practical usage examples and sample outputs.
