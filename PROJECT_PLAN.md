# Project Leela Rebuild Plan

## Core Assessment

Based on a comprehensive analysis of the codebase against the MetaDoc vision and examining all prompts in the prompts directory, I've identified the following:

### Strengths
1. Comprehensive set of sophisticated prompts for all major components
2. Strong prompt implementations for quantum-inspired frameworks
3. Well-designed multi-agent dialectic system with specialized agent prompts
4. Detailed meta-creative spiral with prompts for all phases (Create, Reflect, Abstract, Evolve, Transcend, Return)
5. Established shock generation frameworks (Impossibility Enforcer, Cognitive Dissonance Amplifier)
6. Solid quantum knowledge representation model foundations

### Gaps
1. Disconnect between sophisticated prompts and their implementation in code
2. Missing alternative creativity metaphors (Mycelial, Erosion, Territories)
3. Incomplete implementation of the temporal creativity matrix
4. Limited integration of the dialectic synthesis process
5. Conventional database and API design that doesn't embody quantum principles
6. Missing Counterfactual Creative Evolution implementation

## Tools & Technologies

To accelerate development while keeping the architecture clean, we'll use these key technologies:

### Backend Tools
- **SQLite** - For rapid development and simple persistence without database setup
- **Neo4j** - For implementing quantum entanglement relationships and mycelial networks
- **Redis** (optional) - For maintaining superposition states with fast probabilistic access
- **FastAPI** - For building the quantum-inspired API layer

*Note: We'll start with SQLite for speed and simplicity, with the option to migrate to PostgreSQL later if needed for production scaling.*

### Frontend Tools
- **Next.js** - For the core frontend framework
- **Shadcn UI** - As the foundation for UI components
- **D3.js** (minimal usage) - For simple 2D visualizations of concept networks
- **Framer Motion** (used sparingly) - For subtle, organic animations

## Frontend Considerations

Align the frontend with the rebuilt backend using a simplified, elegant Ghibli-inspired approach:

### Design Philosophy
- Emphasize information clarity with Ghibli's characteristic simplicity
- Use whitespace effectively to create a calm, focused interface
- Implement gentle state transitions rather than complex animations
- Focus on content and usability over visual complexity

### Visual Elements
1. Simple 2D visualizations of quantum creative states
2. Clean, minimalist representation of mycelial connections
3. Subtle visual transformations for the erosion perspective
4. Simple, hand-drawn style maps for conceptual territories
5. Elegant circular representation of the meta-creative spiral
6. Text-based representation of dialectic agents with simple iconic elements

### Shadcn UI Integration

- Use Shadcn UI as the component foundation
- Create a custom theme with Ghibli-inspired color palette:
  - Soft blues and greens from "My Neighbor Totoro"
  - Warm earth tones from "Princess Mononoke"
  - Gentle pastels from "Spirited Away"
- Extend components with simple, slightly imperfect shapes
- Add minimal animations reminiscent of Studio Ghibli's fluid motion style
- Design custom icons with hand-drawn feel
- Prioritize readability and usability while maintaining the Ghibli aesthetic

## Success Metrics

The rebuilt system will be judged successful if it:

1. Generates ideas that experts would consider impossible (shock generation)
2. Evolves its own creative methodologies without pre-programming (meta-creativity)
3. Produces ideas that integrate multiple contradictory perspectives (quantum superposition)
4. Creates solutions that transcend domain boundaries (map vs territories)
5. Demonstrates emergent creative properties not explicitly programmed (emergence)

This plan aims to rebuild Project Leela by fully implementing the sophisticated prompt mechanisms that already exist, while adding missing components from the MetaDoc vision. The focus is on creating a true meta-creative intelligence that discovers fundamentally new ways to think.
