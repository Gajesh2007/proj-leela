# Project Leela Rebuild Preparation

## 1. Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing Framework
- Use **pytest** as the primary testing framework
- Implement parameterized tests for quantum components to test multiple states
- Set up test fixtures for common test scenarios

### Quantum Component Testing
- **Superposition Testing**: Validate probability distributions across states
- **Entanglement Testing**: Ensure correlated state changes propagate correctly
- **Measurement Testing**: Verify probabilistic collapse functions

### Creative Output Evaluation
- Implement automated evaluation metrics:
  - **Novelty Score**: Measure distance from conventional ideas
  - **Coherence Score**: Assess internal consistency of ideas
  - **Surprise Index**: Calculate unexpectedness of connections
  - **Impossibility Rating**: Measure violation of domain constraints
  - **Expert Rejection Probability**: Estimate likelihood of expert dismissal

### Prompt Effectiveness Testing
- Create A/B testing framework to compare prompt versions
- Implement prompt parameter sensitivity analysis
- Establish benchmark problems for consistent evaluation

### Integration Testing
- Test full creative spiral cycles from end to end
- Validate multi-agent dialectic interactions
- Ensure temporal matrix integration works across all eras

### Test Data Management
- Create synthetic test domains with known characteristics
- Maintain benchmark creative problems for regression testing
- Store exemplary outputs as comparison baselines

## 2. Prompt Versioning System

### Versioning Structure
- Implement semantic versioning for prompts (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Store prompts in a structured format (YAML/JSON) with metadata
- Include performance metrics with each prompt version

### Prompt Metadata
- **Author**: Who created/modified the prompt
- **Date**: When the prompt was created/modified
- **Version**: Current version number
- **Dependencies**: Other prompts this one depends on
- **Performance Metrics**: Historical effectiveness measures
- **Change Log**: What changed from previous versions

### Storage Implementation
- Store prompts in version-controlled repository alongside code
- Implement `/prompts/{component}/{version}/` directory structure
- Create automated prompt migration scripts

### Prompt Testing
- Automated regression tests for prompt modifications
- Performance comparison between versions
- A/B testing framework for production evaluation

### Prompt Development Workflow
1. Create draft prompt in development environment
2. Test prompt against benchmark problems
3. Measure performance metrics
4. Submit prompt version for review
5. Release as new version if performance improves

## 3. Migration Path

### Phased Migration Approach
- **Phase 1**: Parallel development of new components
- **Phase 2**: Integration of new components with existing system
- **Phase 3**: Gradual replacement of old components
- **Phase 4**: Complete transition to new architecture

### Feature Parity Checklist
- Create comprehensive feature inventory of current system
- Prioritize features for migration based on usage and importance
- Implement test cases for feature parity validation

### Database Migration
- Create schema migration scripts from current DB to new schema
- Implement data transformation utilities for quantum representation
- Ensure backwards compatibility during transition

### API Compatibility
- Provide compatibility layer for existing API endpoints
- Implement API versioning to support both old and new clients
- Create detailed API change documentation for users

### Rollback Strategy
- Implement feature flags for toggling between old and new implementations
- Create system state backup/restore capabilities
- Establish monitoring for detecting regression in creative quality

## 4. Documentation Architecture

### Internal Development Documentation
- **Architecture Guide**: Overall system design and organization
- **Quantum Mechanisms**: Detailed explanation of quantum-inspired components
- **Prompt Engineering Guide**: Best practices for prompt creation and modification
- **Multi-Agent System**: Dialectic agent interaction patterns
- **Creative Spiral**: Explanation of meta-creative process

### API Documentation
- Use OpenAPI/Swagger for automated API documentation
- Create endpoint-specific examples
- Document quantum state representation formats
- Provide client libraries in multiple languages

### User Documentation
- **Quickstart Guide**: Basic setup and first creative generation
- **Domain Configuration**: Setting up specialized domains
- **Dialectic Setup**: Configuring productive tensions
- **Output Interpretation**: Understanding creative outputs
- **Example Gallery**: Showcase of creative results

### Code Documentation
- Use docstrings for all classes and functions
- Create architecture diagrams for major components
- Maintain living documentation with Sphinx

### Example Projects
- Implement example projects demonstrating key capabilities:
  - **Multi-Domain Integration**: Connecting distant domains
  - **Temporal Perspective Shifting**: Using different historical lenses
  - **Dialectic Synthesis**: Creating tension between perspectives
  - **Meta-Creative Spiral**: Full creative cycle with methodology evolution

## 5. Development Environment Setup

### Containerized Development
- Create Docker Compose setup with all dependencies
- Include Neo4j, SQLite, Redis in development container
- Ensure consistent environment across all developers

### Environment Configuration
- Use `.env` files for local configuration
- Create environment templates for different setups
- Document all configuration options

### Dependency Management
- Use Poetry for Python dependency management
- Lock dependencies for reproducible builds
- Create separate development and production dependency groups

### Local Testing Setup
- Implement test data generation scripts
- Create automated test runners
- Set up CI/CD pipeline configuration

### Getting Started Script
- Create one-command setup script for new developers
- Implement health check to verify environment
- Include sample data generation for immediate testing

## 6. Project Management

### Task Tracking
- Set up GitHub Projects or similar tool
- Create initial task breakdown based on rebuild plan
- Establish priority system based on dependencies

### Development Workflow
- Define Git branching strategy (e.g., GitHub Flow)
- Set up pull request templates
- Establish code review guidelines
- Create contribution guidelines for collaborative development

### Progress Monitoring
- Define key milestones for rebuild progress
- Create component completion checklist
- Establish regular demo schedule

### Communication Structure
- Set up technical documentation wiki
- Create development log for tracking decisions
- Establish regular architecture review meetings

### Success Criteria Validation
- Create measurement framework for success metrics
- Define benchmark problems for testing creative capabilities
- Establish evaluation protocol for creative outputs

## Next Steps

1. Set up development environment with all required tools
2. Create initial testing framework for core components
3. Implement prompt versioning system
4. Develop migration scripts for database schema
5. Create documentation templates
6. Begin implementation of Phase 1 components

By addressing these preparation needs before starting the rebuild, we'll ensure a more structured, maintainable, and successful implementation of Project Leela's ambitious vision.
