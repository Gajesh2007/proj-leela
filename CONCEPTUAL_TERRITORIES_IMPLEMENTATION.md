# Conceptual Territories System Implementation

## Overview

The Conceptual Territories System is an innovative approach to creative idea generation that maps concepts as geographical territories with boundaries, features, and relationships. This metaphorical mapping allows for novel transformations and insights through territorial operations like:

1. **Territory Mapping**: Representing concepts as spatial territories with boundaries, topography, landmarks, and relationships
2. **Boundary Dissolution**: Revealing hidden connections by dissolving artificial boundaries between concepts
3. **Territory Transformation**: Applying transformative processes (like volcanic eruptions or glacial retreats) to reshape conceptual landscapes

This system provides an alternative metaphor for creativity that complements Project Leela's other approaches, particularly valuable for:
- Understanding relationships between concepts
- Finding unexplored areas within conceptual spaces
- Revealing hidden connections between seemingly unrelated ideas
- Transforming concepts through metaphorical natural processes

## Core Components

### 1. Territory Representation

The system represents concepts as territories with:

- **Boundaries**: Clear limits of the conceptual space
- **Topographical Features**: Internal landscape (mountains, valleys, rivers, forests, deserts)
- **Landmarks**: Distinctive concepts, examples, or applications
- **Neighboring Territories**: Adjacent conceptual spaces
- **Unexplored Regions**: Areas not fully developed
- **Indigenous Concepts**: Ideas native to this territory
- **Territorial Conflicts**: Areas of dispute or tension

### 2. Transformation Processes

The system can apply various transformation processes:

- **Tectonic Shift**: Massive fundamental movement of core conceptual foundations
- **Volcanic Eruption**: Sudden, forceful emergence of ideas from deep below
- **Glacial Retreat**: Withdrawal of long-standing structures, revealing previously covered terrain
- **Desertification**: Drying and hardening of previously flexible areas
- **Flooding**: Overflow and saturation with new elements
- **Ecological Succession**: Gradual, systematic replacement of elements

### 3. Idea Generation Framework

The idea generation process follows three key stages:

1. **Territory Mapping**: Mapping the concept as a territory with features and relationships
2. **Boundary Dissolution**: Dissolving boundaries between territories to reveal connections
3. **Territory Transformation**: Applying a transformation process to reshape the territory

## Implementation Details

### Key Classes

#### `ConceptualTerritoriesSystem`

The main class that orchestrates territory mapping, boundary dissolution, and transformation.

```python
@uses_prompt("territory_mapping", dependencies=["territory_dissolution", "territory_transformation"])
class ConceptualTerritoriesSystem:
    """
    Implements territorial mapping and transformation for creative idea generation.
    
    This class models creativity as a process of mapping concepts as territories,
    dissolving boundaries between them, and transforming them through various processes.
    """
    
    async def map_concept_territory(self, concept: Concept) -> ConceptualTerritory:
        # Maps a concept as a territory
        
    async def dissolve_boundaries(self, territory_id: UUID4) -> ConceptualTerritory:
        # Dissolves boundaries between territories
        
    async def transform_territory(self, 
                              territory_id: UUID4,
                              problem_statement: str,
                              transformation_process: Optional[TransformationProcess] = None) -> Tuple[ConceptualTerritory, str]:
        # Transforms a territory through a specified process
        
    async def generate_creative_idea(self, 
                                 territory_id: UUID4, 
                                 problem_statement: str) -> CreativeIdea:
        # Generates a creative idea from a transformed territory
```

#### `ConceptualTerritory`

Represents a concept as a territory with features and relationships.

```python
class ConceptualTerritory:
    """
    Represents a concept as a geographical territory with features and relationships.
    """
    
    def add_feature(self, feature: TerritoryFeature) -> UUID4:
        # Adds a feature to the territory
        
    def add_neighbor(self, neighbor: NeighboringTerritory) -> UUID4:
        # Adds a neighboring territory
        
    def get_features_by_type(self, feature_type: TerritoryFeatureType) -> List[TerritoryFeature]:
        # Gets features by type
```

#### `TerritoryFeature`

Represents a feature within a territory.

```python
class TerritoryFeature:
    """
    Represents a feature within a conceptual territory.
    """
    
    def update_description(self, new_description: str) -> None:
        # Updates the feature description
        
    def add_attribute(self, key: str, value: Any) -> None:
        # Adds an attribute to the feature
```

#### `NeighboringTerritory`

Represents a neighboring territory with relationship information.

```python
class NeighboringTerritory:
    """
    Represents a neighboring territory to a conceptual territory.
    """
```

#### `TransformationProcess` (Enum)

Defines the types of transformation processes that can be applied.

```python
class TransformationProcess(Enum):
    """Types of transformation processes that can reshape territories."""
    TECTONIC_SHIFT = auto()   # Massive fundamental movement
    VOLCANIC_ERUPTION = auto()  # Sudden forceful emergence
    GLACIAL_RETREAT = auto()   # Revealing previously covered areas
    DESERTIFICATION = auto()   # Drying and hardening of flexible areas
    FLOODING = auto()         # Overflow and saturation
    ECOLOGICAL_SUCCESSION = auto()  # Gradual systematic replacement
```

### Prompt Templates

The system relies on three key prompt templates:

1. **`territory_mapping.txt`**: Maps a concept as a territory with features and relationships
2. **`territory_dissolution.txt`**: Dissolves boundaries between territories to reveal connections
3. **`territory_transformation.txt`**: Transforms a territory through a specified process

### Integration with CLI

The system is integrated with the command-line interface:

```
leela territory --domain "domain_name" --problem "problem_statement" --concept "concept_name" --definition "concept_definition" [--transformation TRANSFORMATION_PROCESS] [--output output_file.json]
```

### Usage Example

```python
# Create a concept
concept = Concept(
    id=uuid.uuid4(),
    name="Neighborhood",
    domain="urban planning",
    definition="A neighborhood is a geographic area within a larger city..."
)

# Generate a territory-based idea
idea = await generate_territory_idea(
    problem_statement="How can we design urban environments that enhance social connection?",
    domain="urban planning",
    concept=concept,
    transformation_process=TransformationProcess.VOLCANIC_ERUPTION
)
```

## Advantages and Applications

### Advantages

1. **Spatial Metaphor**: Leverages humans' natural understanding of spatial relationships
2. **Boundary Focus**: Highlights artificial boundaries that may limit creativity
3. **Transformation Processes**: Provides diverse ways to transform concepts, each yielding different insights
4. **Relationship Mapping**: Explicitly models relationships between concepts
5. **Unexplored Regions**: Identifies underexplored areas within conceptual territories

### Applications

The Conceptual Territories System is particularly valuable for:

1. **Conceptual Analysis**: Breaking down complex concepts into constituent parts
2. **Interdisciplinary Work**: Finding connections between different domains
3. **Innovation Strategy**: Identifying unexplored areas within established fields
4. **Problem Reframing**: Seeing old problems from new territorial perspectives
5. **Conflict Resolution**: Understanding tensions between competing conceptual territories

## Conclusion

The Conceptual Territories System provides a powerful spatial metaphor for creativity that complements Project Leela's other approaches. By mapping concepts as territories, dissolving boundaries, and applying transformative processes, it generates novel insights and creative solutions that might not be accessible through other methods.
